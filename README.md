**Workshop Title:** "Hands-on AI Model Installation and Integration: A Guide to OLLAMA and AnythingLLM"

**Workshop Outline:**

***Analogy on how LLM model work***

Imagine a super smart librarian who knows everything about books (like words and phrases). When you ask it a question or give it a task, it searches through its library to find the most relevant answers.

Think of it like having a personal bookshelf assistant! The librarian uses what itâ€™s learned from reading millions of texts to generate answers that are similar in style and tone to human-written content.

Just like how the real librarian might not always have an answer to every question, the AI LLM has its limitations too. But for most questions, it can be a super helpful tool!

1. **Introduction to AI Models**
	* Overview of different types of AI models (e.g., language models, transformer models)
	* **Key Concepts:**
		+ LLaMA 3.3: A large-scale language model developed by Meta AI, known for its high-quality text generation and conversational capabilities.
			- Pros: High accuracy, versatile applications
			- Cons: Large model size, resource-intensive training
		+ DeepSeek R1: An open-source, pre-trained conversational AI model developed by the DeepSeek project, designed for natural language understanding and response generation.
			- Pros: Affordable, high-quality text output
			- Cons: Limited customization options
2. [**Installing OLLAMA Locally**](https://ollama.com/)
	- OLLAMA is an open-source framework that simplifies the installation, configuration, and management of AI models, particularly large language models like GPT, enabling users to work with these models locally across different platforms efficiently.
	* Step-by-step guide on installing OLLAMA on a local machine
	* Troubleshooting common issues
4. **Installing AI Models using OLLAMA**
	- visit [deepseek r1 model](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:14b)
	* copy cli
	* open up preferred terminal & paste
6. **Introduction to AnythingLLM**
	* AnythingLLM is an open-source, Python-based library for managing, installing, and integrating large language models (LLMs) like OLLAMA.
7. **Installing AnythingLLM**
	- visit [AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/)
	- download app in desktop
1. **Connecting AnythingLLM with OLLAMA**
	* How to integrate OLLAMA with AnythingLLM for seamless model switching
	* Best practices for configuration and optimization
2. **Generating OWN GPT Model using AnythingLLM**
	* Overview of the process of generating a custom GPT model using AnythingLLM
	* Tips and tricks for optimizing model performance

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Provide hands-on exercises and real-world examples to illustrate key concepts
* Include time for Q&A, discussion, and practice sessions
* Consider offering resources (e.g., documentation, tutorials) for attendees to continue learning after the workshop
* Encourage attendees to share their experiences and feedback
